Sure, the error message is indicating that the `Socket` object is not being closed properly. This can lead to resource leaks. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public class SocketClient {

    public void testSocket(int index) {
        String serverIp = "127.0.0.1";
        int serverPort = 8888;
        // Use try-with-resources to ensure the Socket is closed properly
        try (Socket socket = new Socket(serverIp, serverPort)) {
            OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();
            String message = "Hello world";
            outputStream.write(message.getBytes());
            outputStream.flush();
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            throw new RuntimeException(ex);
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, I have used a try-with-resources statement. This statement ensures that each resource declared in the try is closed at the end of the statement. This is a feature introduced in Java 7 for automatic resource management. It simplifies the code and ensures that resources are always closed promptly and correctly, even in the face of exceptions.
